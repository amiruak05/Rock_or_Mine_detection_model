# Rock_or_Mine_detection_model
This project will use a data gotten from sonar signals(The Sonar data). The sonar signals are used by submarines to detect objects under the surface of water, by receiving a reflected sound wave. We are going to use K-Nearest Kneigbor pipelines and GridCV search to chose best hyperparameters for optimum model performance
